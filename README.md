My redesign: https://atramucsd.github.io/photrucxanh-2022-website/

## Description

- I created a website for my family restaurant using React, multiple CSS libraries, Photoshop, and Figma. 

- Utilizing react-gh-pages, I've set up my environment to wear I can deploy my code straight to github pages as a fully responsive web page. This is done by utilizing either Yarn or NPM to download react-gh-pages to my modules. 

- Aside from the Tra Thai stock photo, all media was photographed and created by me.
